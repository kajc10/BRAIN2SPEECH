EG Data Format

The EEG data format might differ slightly depending on the acquisition device and preprocessing steps, but typically it consists of the following:

Channels: EEG data is collected from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp. Each electrode's reading is referred to as a channel. A common EEG might have anywhere from a few channels to 256 channels or more.

Sampling Rate: This is the rate at which data is recorded. Common sampling rates in EEG are 250 Hz, 500 Hz, or 1000 Hz, which means the EEG device is recording data 250, 500, or 1000 times per second, respectively.

Time Series Data: For each channel, you'll get a time series of voltage values corresponding to the brain's electrical activity. This time series data, when plotted, will show the various brain waves.

Events/Markers: These are timestamps indicating when a specific event occurred, such as the start of a stimulus or a particular action by the participant. They are used for event-related potential (ERP) studies where the neural response to specific events is analyzed.

Metadata: This includes information about the participant, electrode locations, acquisition parameters, and any preprocessing steps that have been applied.
