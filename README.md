**BRAIN2SPEECH** aims to turn brain activity into synthesized speech by leveraging deep learning methods on EEG (Electroencephalography) data, collected via scalp electrodes. This deep dive into neural exploration paves the way for future BCI technologies that might bypass the need for invasive electrodes, pushing us towards more seamless human-machine interactions.

**Dataset:** The Dataset of Speech Production in intracranial Electroencephalography `(SingleWordProductionDutch)` contains data of 10 participants reading out individual words in Dutch while their intracranial EEG measured from a total of 1103 electrodes:
